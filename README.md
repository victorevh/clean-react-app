**This boilerplate contains the following settings:**
- Local storage adapter;
- Axios as HTTP Client;
- Webpack configured for development and production environments;
- Basic end-to-end test settings with Cypress;
- Unit tests with Jest;
- Husky with pre-push to run unit tests;
- Authentication with validations;
- Validation layer for reuse of validations;
- Some hooks to help with API calls and form submissions;
- Private route configured;
- Three pages to help improve productivity:
  - Login page

## :construction_worker:  **Installation**

**You must first have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (I recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to deal with versions), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and then:**

`git clone https://github.com/rubemfsv/clean-react-app.git`

Step 1:

`cd clean-react-app` - access the project files

Step 2:

`yarn` (or `npm install`) - to install dependencies

Step 3:

Change your `webpack.dev.js` and `webpack.prod.js` env url to your real urls

Step 4:

`yarn dev` (or `npm run dev`) - to initialize the project under development

Observations:

`yarn test` (or `npm run test`) - to run jest unit testing

`yarn test:e2e` (or `npm run test:e2e`) - to run cypress e2e testing (if you use linux or windows, the command may change because of the \, but you can change the script or run it by `node_modules/.bin/cypress open`)

`yarn start` (or `npm start`) - to initialize the project under production webpack;

In the package.json file, there are scripts that you can run with node and yarn

## :open_file_folder: **Architecture**

The architecture used in this project was the [Clean Architecture](https://dev.to/rubemfsv/clean-architecture-the-concept-behind-the-code-52do), using the concepts proposed by Roberto Martin. To know how to implement this architecture, there is an [article applying this Architecture with React](https://dev.to/rubemfsv/arquitetura-limpa-aplicando-com-react-1eo0) that describes very well the thought line.
